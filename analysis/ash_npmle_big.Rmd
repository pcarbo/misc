# Background

The NPMLE for the EB normal means problem is a discrete distribution.
For n=1000 I've found it is "quite" discrete, with just a few masses.
What happens for larger n?



```{r}
set.seed(1)
library("ashr")
bhat = rnorm(100000,0,2)
grid = seq(from = min(bhat),to = max(bhat),length = 100)
k    = length(grid)
b.ash.npmle = ash(bhat,1,g = unimix(pi = rep(1/(k-1),(k-1)),a = grid[-k],b = grid[-1]),method = "shrink")
plot(grid[-1],get_fitted_g(b.ash.npmle)$pi)
b.ash.npmle$loglik
sum(dnorm(bhat,0,2,log=TRUE))
```
